# DevopsLearn
This is a journal like repository where I will write about my path in learning Devops.
I am currently following DevOps Beginners to Advanced with Projects - 2023 course on Udemy.
I want to record all the new stuff I am learning everytime. I hope I will update the journal at least 3-4 times a week. Wish me luck! ^_^
